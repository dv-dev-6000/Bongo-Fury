# BongoFury
## The Game (WIP)
Bongo Fury is a concept for a co-op focused 2d platformer where 2 players control 1 player character. One player controls navigation while the second inputs bongo combos which trigger the characters special moves, when the character takes damage the roles switch. 

## Level Editor
The repo contains a custom-made level editor dev tool, this allows for quick and easy design of tile based levels which can be exported as csv files for generation in game. the editor is created as a standalone program so it can be implemented into any project. The tool currently supports the following features:

* scrolling camera with adjustable zoom
* collapsable user interface toolbar
* variable sized level grid
* up to 12 placeable tile types
* toggle for grid visibility
* toggle for paint mode (click and drag for multiple tile placement)
* export to CSV function

Currently the level editor is a dev tool tailored to use for the bongo fury project. Future updates to the level editor will be focused on UI and UX improvements to facilitate release as a public facing tool as well as feature additions such as export to JSON and support for more tile varieties and import of custom tile sets.
